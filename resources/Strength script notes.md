Coincidental rules
```
19.1 Coincidental Minor Penalties - When coincidental minor penalties or
coincidental minor penalties of equal duration are imposed against
players of both teams, the penalized players shall all take their places
on the penalty benches and such penalized players shall not leave the
penalty bench until the first stoppage of play following the expiry of
their respective penalties. Where goalkeepers are involved, refer to
27.1. Immediate substitution shall be made for an equal number of
minor penalties or coincidental minor penalties of equal duration to
each team so penalized and the penalties of the players for which
substitutions have been made shall not be taken into account for the
purpose of the delayed penalty rule (Rule 26 – Delayed Penalties).
This rule only applies when at least one team is already serving a time
penalty in the penalty box that causes them to be short-handed.
When one minor penalty is assessed to one player of each team at
the same stoppage in play, these penalties will be served without
substitution provided there are no other penalties in effect and visible
on the penalty clocks. Both teams will therefore play four skaters
against four skaters for the duration of the minor penalties.
Should one or both of these players (or any other players) also
incur a misconduct penalty in addition to their one minor penalty, this
rule shall apply and the teams would still play four skaters against four
skaters (the player incurring the misconduct penalty would have to
serve the entire 12 minutes – minor plus misconduct – and his team
would have to place an additional player on the penalty bench to serve
the minor penalty and be able to return to the ice when the minor
penalty expires).
When multiple penalties are assessed to both teams, equal
numbers of minor and major penalties shall be eliminated using the
coincidental penalty rule and any differential in time penalties shall be
served in the normal manner and displayed on the penalty time clock
accordingly (see 19.5). If there is no differential in time penalties, all
players will serve their allotted penalty time, but will not be released
until the first stoppage of play following the expiration of their
respective penalties.
For coincidental penalties that carry over into, or are assessed
during regular-season overtime, refer to 84.3, to Reference Tables –
Table 15 – Penalties In Effect Prior to the Start of Overtime – Regular
Season on page 159, and to Reference Tables – Table 16 – Penalties
Assessed in Overtime – Regular Season on page 160. 

19.2 Coincidental Major Penalties - When coincidental major penalties or
coincidental penalties of equal duration, including a major and/or a
match penalty, are imposed against players of both teams, the
penalized players shall all take their places on the penalty benches
and such penalized players shall not leave the penalty benches until
the first stoppage of play following the expiry of their respective
penalties. Immediate substitutions shall be made for an equal number
of major penalties, or coincidental penalties of equal duration including
a major penalty to each team so penalized, and the penalties of the 
players for which substitutions have been made shall not be taken into
account for the purpose of the delayed penalty rule, (Rule 26 –
Delayed Penalties). In such situations, if one or both players have
received a game misconduct in addition to their major penalties, no
substitutes are required to take their places on the penalty benches. 

19.3 Coincidental Match Penalties - When coincidental match penalties
or coincidental penalties of equal duration, including a major and/or a
match penalty, are imposed against players of both teams, the players
with the match penalties shall be immediately removed from the
game. The remaining penalized players shall not leave the penalty
benches until the first stoppage of play following the expiry of their
respective penalties. Immediate substitutions shall be made for an
equal number of major and/or match penalties, or coincidental
penalties of equal duration including a major or match penalty to each
team so penalized, and the penalties of the players for which
substitutions have been made shall not be taken into account for the
purpose of the delayed penalty rule, (Rule 26 – Delayed Penalties). 

19.4 Last Five Minutes and Overtime - During the last five (5) minutes of
regulation time, or at any time in overtime, when a minor penalty (or
double-minor penalty) is assessed to one player of Team A, and a
major (or match) penalty is assessed to one player of Team B at the
same stoppage of play, the three-minute (or one-minute) differential
shall be served immediately as a major penalty. This is also applicable
when coincidental penalties are negated, leaving the aforementioned
examples. In such instances, the team of the player receiving the
major penalty must place the replacement player in the penalty bench
prior to expiration of the penalty. In the case of a match penalty, the
team must place the replacement player in the penalty bench
immediately. The differential will be recorded on the penalty clock as a
three (3) minute or a one (1) minute penalty (as applicable), and
served in the same manner as a major penalty. This rule shall be
applied regardless as to the on-ice strength of the two teams at the
time the above outlined penalties are assessed.
19.5 Applying the Coincidental Penalty Rule – When multiple penalties
are assessed to both teams at the same stoppage of play, the
following rules are to be utilized by the Referees to determine the onice strength for both teams:
(i) Cancel as many major and/or match penalties as possible
(ii) Cancel as many minor, bench minor and or double-minor penalties as
possible

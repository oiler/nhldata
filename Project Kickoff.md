PROBLEM OVERVIEW
The NHL generates a play by play event log for every game. It provides a record of every tracked event that happens during a game. It has added the "situationCode" value that tells us at what strength each logged event happens. But the play by play log does not include some events that are important, like when the situationCode changes — for example when a penalty expires and the play goes from 5v4 to 5v5.

SOLUTION
A real play log should include an entry for every second the game is played. Seconds are the atoms of each NHL season, game, period, and event. Everything can be tied to what second it was recorded at. One of the great benefits of logging by seconds is that it gives us the simple ability to break down how much of the game happens at 5v5 vs other situations. So for every NHL game, we want to generate a log of every second. If no other event is logged at a second, it can at least log the situationCode. So we should create this both in csv and json format.

HOW WE SHOULD WORK
We will need to break this project up into small achievable tasks that are measured and tracked along the way. I would like to be able to easily refer to them, so for each feature let's come up with a test and a name (numbered preferably) to make it easy to come back to. Once we start building, we want to go one step at a time. Build, test, verify, and move on to the next. After each step, I will also manually review and if approved to proceed, I will manually commit our changes to our repo so we have a good save point. For example, If we are on feature 5, and need to go back to feature 2 to make changes, we should be able to easily do that work on 2, test and ship it, and then come back to our work on 5. If there are any questions along the way, pause to ask for clarify. If you get stuck trying to figure something out and have conflicting logic, pause and report back and we can work it out together. You don't need to do this all yourself, I am here to guide and help the project. You are welcome to suggest solutions, but my updates should always take priority over other instructions. Finally, we need to make sure we are saving important logic into markdown documents that we can use as a source of truth when things get complex. Those documents are our guiding principles and they define how we will complete this project together.

# SECTION 4 – TYPES OF PENALTIES

## Rule 26 – Delayed Penalties

**26.1 Delayed Penalty** – If a **third player** of any team is penalized while **two players** of the same team are already serving penalties, the penalty time for the third player **shall not commence until the penalty time of one of the two players already penalized has elapsed**,. The third penalized player must go to the **penalty bench immediately**,. To ensure the team maintains a minimum of **three skaters** on the ice, a substitute player may be used,.

**26.2 Penalty Expiration** – When a team has **three players** serving penalties simultaneously and a substitute for the third offender is on the ice due to the delayed penalty rule, **none of the three penalized players may return to the ice until play has stopped**,. Once play is stopped, any player whose penalty has fully expired is permitted to return to the ice,. 

During active play, the **Penalty Timekeeper** will allow penalized players to return to the ice in the **order their penalties expire**, but **only when the penalized team is entitled to have more than four players on the ice**,. If the team is not entitled to more than four players, the penalized players must **wait until the first stoppage of play** following their penalty expiration to be released,. 

In cases where the penalties of two players on the same team expire at the same time, the **Captain of that team must designate** which player will return to the ice first,. The Referee will then instruct the Penalty Timekeeper accordingly to facilitate the release of a player should the opposing team score on a power-play,.

**26.3 Major and Minor Penalty** – If a **major and a minor penalty** are imposed at the same time on different players of the same team, the Penalty Timekeeper is required to **record the minor penalty as the first penalty** to be served,.

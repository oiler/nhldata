# SECTION 4 – TYPES OF PENALTIES

## Rule 19 – Coincidental Penalties

**19.1 Coincidental Minor Penalties** – When coincidental minor penalties or those of equal duration are imposed against players of both teams, the penalized players must take their places on the penalty benches and **shall not leave until the first stoppage of play following the expiry of their respective penalties**. Immediate substitution is made for an equal number of minor penalties, and these are not taken into account for the purpose of the delayed penalty rule (Rule 26). This specific rule **only applies when at least one team is already serving a time penalty** that causes them to be short-handed.

When one minor penalty is assessed to one player of each team at the same stoppage and no other penalties are in effect, these penalties are served without substitution, and teams play **four skaters against four skaters**. If a misconduct penalty is also incurred by these players, the teams still play four-on-four, but the team must place an **additional player on the penalty bench** to serve the minor penalty and return to the ice when it expires. 

When multiple penalties are assessed, equal numbers of minor and major penalties are eliminated; any **differential in time penalties** is served in the normal manner and displayed on the clock. For coincidental penalties during regular-season overtime, officials refer to Rule 84.3 and Reference Tables 15 and 16.

**19.2 Coincidental Major Penalties** – When coincidental major penalties or penalties of equal duration (including a major and/or match penalty) are imposed, players take their places on the penalty benches and remain until the **first stoppage of play following the expiry** of their penalties. Immediate substitutions are made for an equal number of major penalties. In these situations, if a player has also received a **game misconduct**, no substitutes are required to take their places on the penalty benches.

**19.3 Coincidental Match Penalties** – When coincidental match penalties (or penalties of equal duration including a major/match penalty) are imposed, players with match penalties are **immediately removed from the game**. The remaining penalized players stay on the penalty benches until the first stoppage following their penalty expiry. Immediate substitutions are made for an equal number of major and/or match penalties.

**19.4 Last Five Minutes and Overtime** – During the **last five minutes of regulation or any time in overtime**, if a minor (or double-minor) is assessed to Team A and a major (or match) is assessed to Team B at the same stoppage, the **three-minute (or one-minute) differential** is served immediately as a major penalty. The team receiving the major penalty must place a replacement player on the penalty bench before the penalty expires (or immediately for a match penalty). This rule is applied **regardless of the on-ice strength** of the teams at the time of assessment.

**19.5 Applying the Coincidental Penalty Rule** – When multiple penalties are assessed to both teams at the same stoppage, Referees determine on-ice strength by:
*   **(i) Canceling as many major and/or match penalties as possible**.
*   **(ii) Canceling as many minor, bench minor, and/or double-minor penalties as possible**.

Further details and examples can be found in **Reference Table 13 – Coincidental Penalties**.
